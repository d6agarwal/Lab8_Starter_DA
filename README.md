How are graceful degradation and service workers related? 
Graceful degradation basically means that for instances when the functionality is unavailable due to various reasons such as not being connected to the internet, the experience will understandbly be not as good as it would be if the conditions were appropriate. But rather than the platform becoming totally unusable, we should try to have the basic functionality and core features still there. This is where service workers come in as they allowed us to access the recipes even when we were offline which retained functionality because of caching and improved reliability, so it is pretty useful.
